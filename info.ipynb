    "This project on computational gravitational physics analyses raw data regarding the strain occurring in the arms of LIGO interferometers   in  case of contact with a gravitational wave. Gravitational waves disturb the spacetime along which it travels, and hence it causes  spatial consequences like strain. LIGO arms are designed such that they always produce destructive interference, but when there is change  in spacetime, one of the lenghts of the arms increases while the other (perpendicular to it) decreases. Thus, the light in the two arms  are no longer out of phase for destructive interference and light is observed in the detector; this is how strain is measured.   \n",
    "  \n",
    "However, the raw strain data is very noisy due to other spatial reasons, and gravitational waves cannot be directly deciphered from it.  Hence, lot of derivations and computations are required on the raw strain data before the existence of gravitational waves can be concluded.  \n",
    "The first gravitational wave was observed through LIGO interferometers on 14 September 2015 (named GW150914).  \n",
    "  \n",
    "This project replicates the computations and plots involved in concluding the existence of GW150914. It lies an essential achievement in the history  of science, not only because it validates the predictions made by the General Theory of Relativity, but also because of the computations involved in it   that make science even easier.  \n",
